/* reqs:
- each philo should be a thread
- one fork between each pair of philos -> (one philo, one fork)
- each fork state needs a protection using mutex (philos?)

num_philos:
even: time_to_die = time_to_eat + time_to_sleep + 10

odd:  time_to_die = time_to_eat * 2 + time_to_sleep + 10

1) odd sleep at beginning for (time_to_eat / 2)
2) odd start taking from right fork, even from left
3) all philos take from right fork, except for last one (takes from left)

philos next to each other cannot ever eat at the same time

if time to die is less than sum of time_to_eat + time_to_sleep
before philosopher sleeps, update last meal time

- philos cannot check themselves for death (thread busy with action and cannot check death time)
	-> one thread checks time - last_eat_time == time_to_die) - once req_meals have been reached, stop
- some philos eat at same time (4 or more)

- single philo will always die (cannot eat without 2 forks)

Things to consider:
- printf interference
- own usleep (for precision)
- avoid infinite loops

- use setters and getters for mutex states

- use valgrind --tool=helgrind -> check
- use fsanitize=thread
